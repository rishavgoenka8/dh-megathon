For our 'AI for Good' project we developed an intrusion detection system (IDS) using an auto encoder machine learning model.Our project involved training an auto encoder model using a large dataset of network traffic to detect anomalies in network behaviour. The MarkovML platform made it easy for us to preprocess and upload our dataset, as well as experiment with different auto encoder architectures to find the best one for our needs.One of the most helpful features of the MarkovML platform was its ability to provide real-time feedback on our model's performance. This allowed us to fine-tune our model and achieve a high level of accuracy in detecting network intrusions.The platform's visualisation features were also essential in helping us understand the data and model results. We were able to quickly generate visualisations of our model's predictions, allowing us to pinpoint the source of anomalies in network behaviour.Overall, I'm incredibly impressed with the MarkovML platform and its ability to simplify the process of building and training machine learning models. It's been an excellent experience collaborating with the team, and I'm excited to see the potential impact of our work.I would like to thank the entire team at MarkovML for making this such an incredible learning experience. Especially my mentors, Kushagra Arora and Sharath Savasere for guiding me through the entire program. I would also like to thank Harshwardhan Prasad and Lindsey Meyl for coming up this amazing program.", "Another hour another feature, we are on ThePrint as well. Thank you so much for featuring us.
